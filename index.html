                            <p>My name is Mason Hester. I was born June 25th 1997. My first job experience was landscaping which mainly consisted of shoveling dense grade,
                                digging out foundations, trimming bushes and small trees, and other tasks related to maintaining yards. I was landscaping 
                                on and off from my junior year to my senior year in highschool.</p>
                       
                            <p>A year after highschool I started work at DHL. DHL is the largest international shipping company. I joined DHL 2 months 
                                before they started running all of the Amazon Freight for the United States through their central hub. When I started I was 
                                initially an unloader which consisted of moving the freight from the containers onto the converyer belt. After 3 weeks 
                                I was changed to utility where I had to move the containers of freight from the planes to the conveyer belt. 4 months 
                                later I was promoted to Lead of Inbound Data Entry. As Lead of Inbound Data Entry it was my responsibilty to ensure that 
                                every container of freight that DHL received from Amazon entered the building and was completely unloaded, creating 
                                frameoworks on ways to track statistics such as issues with the manifestation of freight, and ensuring that everyone within 
                                my department were completing their tasks fully and on time.</p>
